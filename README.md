# NodeJs-WeatherApp
Using the `OpenWeatherMap` API to build a simple Application which displays Temperature, Country Name and Location of the City.

In this Code i have used the [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org/) API and display the result to the console.
Create an account and generate the API Key.

Create a directory named `NodeJs-WeatherApp` and run the command 

> npm init 

This will create a `package.json` file.  

To call the API i have used the npm module called [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request). This is used to make HTTP requests. Run the following command to install it.

> npm install request --save

Here is a screen-shot of the output.
